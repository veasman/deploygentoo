# Deploy Gentoo

A small set of scripts to help me deploy gentoo quicker after a fresh install. Most of what these scripts do is install software I would normally install manually.

## Installation

- WARNING: These scripts use "doas" instead of "sudo"
```bash
git clone https://github.com/veasman/deploygentoo.git
cd deploygentoo
./master-install.sh
```
